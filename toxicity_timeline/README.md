### Background
Comments are scraped from predefined websites which are then scored with Perspective API's AnalyzeComment request. This data is then shown as a graph of toxicity over time. The idea is that it may be possible to identify trends of comments. For example:

 - Are comments more likely to be more toxic once one toxic comment has been posted?
 - When is the most toxic time of the day?

### Usage
Visit any article that contains comments from the below publishers. Once loaded click the app icon in the extensions panel to see the toxic graph for the story.

- [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk)
- [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com)
- [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk)
