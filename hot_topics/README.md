### Background
The Perspective API could be used to help predict the toxicity of future articles depending on the average toxicity score of each article within a certain category. There is a sample dataset of toxicity per category stored in `hot_topics/parsed-data.json` which is used by the Chrome extension.

### Usage
Install the Chrome Extension and view [this](https://conversationai.github.io/perspectives-hacks/hot_topics/example/index.html) page. The average toxic score will be displayed as a side panel.

This is example code to help experimentation with the Perspective API; it is not an official Google product.
